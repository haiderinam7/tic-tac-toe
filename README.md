## Introduction

This Tic-Tac-Toe game was developed as a hands-on project while following a Udemy course focused on React. The project reinforces essential concepts such as component splitting, state management, prop forwarding, and dynamic JSX rendering.

## Features

- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- Reusable and modular components
- State management and state lifting
- Conditional rendering and prop forwarding
- Customizable and dynamic components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/haiderinam7/tic-tac-toe.git

### Concepts Covered

- Working with Fragments: Implementing components without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
- Component Splitting: Organizing components by feature and state for better reusability and maintainability.
- Prop Forwarding: Ensuring props are passed correctly to inner elements.
- Dynamic JSX Slots: Working with multiple JSX slots and setting component types dynamically.
- State Management: Lifting state up, reducing unnecessary state, and sharing state across components.Conditional Rendering: Disabling buttons and updating state based on conditions.
- Immutability: Handling state changes immutably to avoid side effects.

### Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code.
  - `components/`: Folder containing individual components.
  - `assets/`: Stores images and other static assets.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
